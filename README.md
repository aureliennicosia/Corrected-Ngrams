# Corrected-Ngrams

This shiny app is a presentation of a work presented at the SAS Global Forum student symposium. 
The main objective of this work is to properly look at the popularity of some words in the
Google Ngram corpuses by taking into account of the growth of the scientific literature.

## How to run the app:
You must have R and the Shiny package installed, and then running the app is as easy as entering the following command:
